# PvC DS Demo - Data Generation


To generate data, there are two ways:

1. Use the script link:gen_data.sh[gen_data.sh] to generate data. You will need to change variables at the top of the script to match your environment. 
    
1. Do it manually by pushing files present in link:data/[data/] and follow the readme there to push data into various services.


## Generate Data with Datagen

1. Install jq on the node where you are launching the script: __yum install jq__

1. Make sure gen_data.sh is executable: __chmod +x gen_data.sh __

1. In link:gen_data.sh[gen_data.sh] script change the hostname and user/password of datagen to yours

1. Launch data generation with: __./gen_data.sh__


Later, if you want to scale, you can relaunch gen_data.sh with a parameter among: small (~1 GB of data), medium (~10s GB of data), large (~100s GB of data), extra large (~1 TB of data).



## Load Data using the samples


TODO: ADD samples and procedure to load them to the cluster.
